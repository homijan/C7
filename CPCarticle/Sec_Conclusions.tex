\begin{itemize}
  \item The~most important point is that we introduce a~collision operator, 
    which is coherent with the full FP, i.e. no extra dependence on $\Zbar$.
  \item Touch pros/contras of linearized FP in Aladin and Impact vs AWBS
  \item Raise discussion about what is the weakest point of AP1 for high Kns: 
    the~velocity limit or phenomenological Maxwellization?
  \item Summarize useful outcomes related to plasma physics as 
    the~tendency of the~velocity maximum in $q_1$ with respect to $\Zbar$ and
	Kn$^e$.
  \item Emphasize the~good results of Aladin (compared to Impact) and also
    outstanding results of Calder while being PIC. 
\end{itemize}
