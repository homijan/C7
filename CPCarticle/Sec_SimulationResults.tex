\subsection{Simulation results}
\label{sec:SimulationResults}
The~first test case is a~simple non-linear heat-bath problem, 
in which the~initial temperature is $\tanh(z)$.  
The~total computational box size is 700 $\mu$m in the~case
of Aladin and Impact and 1000 $\mu$m in the~case of Calder.
The~Knudsen number has been varied to address a~broad range of nonlocality of 
the~electron transport corresponding to the~laser-heated plasma conditions,
i.e. Kn$^e \in (0.0001, 1)$. The~variation of Kn$^e$ arises from the~variation
of the~electron density $n_e \in (10^{19}, 10^{23})$ cm$^{-3}$ or the~slope of 
the~temperature profile $s \in (25, 2500) \mu$m. The~coulomb logarithm was held
fixed throughout, $\lnc = 7.09$.

  Simulation results for the case $Z=2$ computed by AP1/Aladin/Impact/Calder.
  Every point corresponds to the maximum heat flux in a "tanh" temperature 
  simulation, which can be characterized by Kn. The range of 
  $\log_{10}(\text{Kn})\in (0, -4)$ can be expressed as equivalent 
  to the~electron density approximate range n$_e \in (1e19, 3.5e22)$ of 
  the~50 $\mu$m slope tanh case. In the case of Kn = 0.56, 
  $q_{Aladin} / q_{AP1}\approx 7.9$.}
