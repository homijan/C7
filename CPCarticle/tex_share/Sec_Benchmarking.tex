\section{Benchmarking the~AWBS nonlocal transport model}
\label{sec:BenchmarkingAWBS}
After having shown several encouraging properties of the~AWBS transport 
equation defined by \eqref{eq:AWBS_model} under local diffusive conditions
in \secref{sec:DiffusiveKinetics}, this section provides a~broader analysis
of the~electron transport and focuses on analyzing its behavior under variety of
conditions in plasmas. In principle, this is characterized by allowing that
electron mean free path can be arbitrarily long, which leads to so-called 
nonlocal electron transport extensively investigated in numerous publications 
\cite{Malone_1975_15, Colombant_PoP2005, Bell_1981_83, LMV_1983_7, Brantov_Nonlocal_electron_transport_1998, schurtz2000, Sorbo_2015}.
Among a~variety of tests suitable for benchmarking the~nonlocal electron 
transport models published 
\cite{Epperlein_PoFB1991, marocchino2013, Sorbo_2015, 
Sorbo_2016, Sherlock_PoP2017, Brodrick_PoP2017}, we focus on 
conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion plasmas generated by lasers.
We show results of our implementation of the~AP1 nonlocal transport model 
presented in \secref{sec:AWBSnonlocal} benchmarked against simulation results
provided by Calder, a~collisional Particle-In-Cell
code, and by Aladin and Impact \cite{Kingham_JCP2004} VFP codes. 
%Their description follows in the~next section.

\textbf{Calder PIC code}

In the~limit of classical physics, a~fluid description of the~particle 
phase-space, including small angle binary collisions, can be described with 
the~Maxwell equations \eqref{eq:Faraday}, \eqref{eq:Ampere}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%&&\nabla\cdot \mathbf{E}=\sum_\alpha \frac{q_\alpha}{\varepsilon_0} n_{\alpha},\\
%&&\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}=0,\\
%&&\nabla\vect{\times} \mathbf{E}+\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=0,\\
%&&\nabla\vect{\times} \mathbf{B}-\mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}=\mu_0\sum_\alpha\mathbf{j}_{\alpha},\label{maxw}
%\end{eqnarray}
coupled with the~ion and electron Vlasov equations with 
the~Landau-Beliaev-Budker collisions integral (LBB)
\cite{Landau_1936, Beliaev_SPD1956} 
\begin{multline}
\frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}f_\alpha+q_\alpha\left(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\vect{\times}\mathbf{B}\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{p}}f_\alpha =
\\
C_{LBB}(f_\alpha,f_\alpha)+\sum_\beta C_{LBB}(f_\alpha,f_\beta)
.
\end{multline}
The LBB collision integral takes the~form
\begin{multline}
C_{LBB}(f_\alpha,f_\beta)=
\\
-\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{p}}\cdot\frac{\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}}{2}\left[\int \mathbf{U}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{p}^\prime)\cdot(f_\alpha\nabla_{\mathbf{p}^\prime}f_\beta^\prime-f_\beta^\prime\nabla_{\mathbf{p}}f_\alpha)\right]d^3\mathbf{p}^\prime
,
\label{eq:LBB_model}
\end{multline}
where its relativistic kernel reads
$\mathbf{U}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{p}^\prime)=\frac{r^2/\gamma\gamma^\prime}{(r^2-1)^{3/2}}$ 
$\left[(r^2-1)\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{p}\otimes\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{p}^\prime\otimes\mathbf{p}^\prime+r(\mathbf{p}\otimes\mathbf{p}^\prime+\mathbf{p}^\prime\otimes\mathbf{p})\right]$
with $\gamma=\sqrt{1+\mathbf{p}^2}$, $\gamma^\prime=\sqrt{1+\mathbf{p}^{\prime 2}}$ and $r=\gamma\gamma^\prime-\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}^\prime$. 
The momemtum $\mathbf{p}_\alpha$ ($\mathbf{p}_\beta$) is normalized to 
$m_\alpha c$ (resp. $m_\beta c$). The~collision operator \eqref{eq:LBB_model} 
tends to \eqref{eq:LFP_model} in the non-relativistic limit.
%described in Appendix~\ref{app:CalderKinetics}. 
%The~latter is the~relativistic version of the~collision operator 
%introduced in \eqref{eq:LFP_model}. 
The aforementioned model is solved in 3D by the PIC code CALDER. 
\cite{Lefebvre_NF2003, Perez_PoP2012}.

Brief description of the Calder code \figref{fig:C7_Calder_case1}.

\textbf{Impact and Aladin VFP codes}

The~PIC code is extremely expensive as the~collisions require the~description 
of the~velocity space in 3 dimensions. Yet, a~reduction of dimensions can be 
done by developing the~distribution function in a~cartesian tensor series, 
equivalent to a~serie along the spherical harmonics \cite{Johnston_PR1960}
as follows:
\begin{equation}
  f(t,\mathbf{x},\vv) = f_0(t,\mathbf{x},\vmag) 
  + \vn\cdot \vect{f}_1(t,\mathbf{x},\vmag)
  +\vn\otimes\vn:\matr{f}_2(t,\mathbf{x},\vmag)+... .
  \label{Pn}
\end{equation}
%where $v=|\mathbf{v}|$, $\Omega=\mathbf{v}/v$. 
A P$_n$ model refers to 
neglecting orders higher than $\matr{f}_n$. The distribution function 
approximation $f(t,\mathbf{x},\vv)\approx f_0(t,\mathbf{x},\vmag)
+\vn\cdot \vect{f}_1(t,\mathbf{x},\vmag)$ coupled with 
the~Landau-Fokker-Planck collisional operator 
\eqref{eq:LFP_model}, leads to the P$_1$-VFP model 
\cite{Johnston_PR1960, Kingham_JCP2004}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial t}+\frac{\vmag}{3}\nabla \cdot f_1
+\frac{\qe}{3\me\vmag^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \vmag}(\vmag^2\E\cdot \mathbf{f}_1)
&=&
C^0_{ee}(f_0) ,
 \label{eq:P1f0_Aladin}\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}_1}{\partial t}+\vmag\nabla f_0
+ \frac{\qe\E}{\me}\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial \vmag}
+\frac{\qe\B}{\me}\vect{\times} \mathbf{f}_1 
&=&
- \nuei\mathbf{f}_1 .
\label{eq:P1f1_Aladin}
\end{eqnarray}
where for simplicity only the~isotropic 
contribution of \eqref{eq:LFP_model} is used 
\begin{eqnarray} 
C^0_{ee}(f_0) &=& \frac{\Gamma}{v^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \vmag}
\left[C(f_0)f_0+D(f_0)\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial \vmag}\right] ,
\\
C(f_0(\vmag)) &=& 4\pi\int_0^\vmag f_0(u) u^2 \dI u ,
\\
D(f_0(\vmag)) &=& \frac{4\pi}{\vmag}\int_0^\vmag u^2\int_u^\infty w f_0(w) 
\dI w \dI u .
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{comment} % Hydro quantities.
The electron and energy densities are obtained from the isotropic part of the distribution function $f_0$:
\begin{eqnarray}
n_e=4\pi\int_{\mathbf{R}^+} f_0v^2dv,\\
U_e=2\pi m_e\int_{\mathbf{R}^+} f_0v^4dv,
\end{eqnarray}
and the electron current and heat flux are obtained from the anisotropic part of the distribution function $\mathbf{f}_1$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{j}_e=-\frac{4\pi e}{3}\int_{\mathbf{R}^+} \mathbf{f}_1v^3dv,\\
\mathbf{Q}_e=\frac{2\pi m_e}{3}\int_{\mathbf{R}^+} \mathbf{f}_1v^5dv.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{comment} % Hydro quantities.

Impact and Aladin solve the system \eqref{eq:P1f0_Aladin} 
and \eqref{eq:P1f1_Aladin} with the Maxwell equations  
\eqref{eq:Faraday} and \eqref{eq:Ampere} in two dimensions, 
assuming motionless ions.

It is worth mentioning that AP1 leans on similar model equations as Aladin
and Impact with the~difference, that AP1 describes electron distribution 
function as quasi steady with respect to the~time evolution of ion fluid,
and of course, AP1 is using a~simple (linear) collision operator inherently
coupled to ion fluid via $\fM$.

The accuracy of the AP1 implementation is compared to Aladin, Impact and Calder
codes by calculating the heat flow in the case
where a~large relative temperature variation
\begin{equation}
  T_e(z) = 0.575 - 0.425 \tanh\left((z-450) s\right) ,
  \label{eq:T_init}
\end{equation}
which exhibits a~smooth steep gradient at point 450~$\mu$m 
connecting a~hot bath ($T_e = 1$~keV) 
and cold bath ($T_e = 0.17$~keV) and $s$ is the~parameter of steepness. 
This test is referred to as a~simple non-linear heat-bath problem and
originally was introduced in \cite{marocchino2013} and further investigated
in  \cite{Sorbo_2015, Sorbo_2016, Sherlock_PoP2017, Brodrick_PoP2017}.

%Aladin and Impact simulations showed an evolution of the heat flow
%from the local (due to initialising as a Maxwellian) to the
%nonlocal, with a reduced peak, over an initial transient
%phase (over which the temperature ramp flattened somewhat). 
%The transient phase was considered over when the
%ratio of the VFP heat flow to the expected local heat
%flow stopped decreasing. After the transient phase this
%ratio begins to slowly increase as the thermal conduction flattens 
%the temperature ramp and the ratio of the scalelength to mfp increases 
%(i.e. the thermal transport slowly becomes more local). 

The~total computational box size is 700 $\mu$m in the~case
of Aladin and Impact and 1000 $\mu$m in the~case of Calder.
We performed Aladin, Impact, and Calder simulations showing an~evolution of
temperature starting from the~initial profile \eqref{eq:T_init}. 
Due to an~inexact initial distribution function (approximated by Maxwellian),
the~first phase of the~simulation exhibits a~transient behavior of the~heat
flux. After several ps the~distribution adjusts properly to its nonlocal nature
and the~actual heat flux profile can be compared. 
We then take the temperature profile from Aladin/Impact/Calder and used 
our AP1 implementation to calculate the heat flow
it would predict given this profile. 
For all heat-bath simulations the electron density, Coulomb logarithm and 
ionisation were kept constant and uniform.
The~coulomb logarithm was held fixed throughout, $\lnc = 7.09$.

In \figref{fig:C7_Aladin_case3}, \figref{fig:C7_Calder_case1}, 
and \figref{fig:C7_Aladin_case5} we show AP1 results for various ionization
states in the~case of a~moderate nonlocality (Kn$^e \sim 10^{-2}$) 
corresponding to a~rouhgly 50 $\%$ inhibition of the~heat flux maximum. 
We prefer to use 
$\text{Kn}^e = \frac{\mfpe}{\sqrt{\Zbar + 1}L_{T_e}}$ instead of
 $\text{Kn}^e = \frac{\mfpei}{L_{T_e}}$, because $\sqrt{\Zbar + 1}$ provides 
a~better scaling of nonlocality with respect
to ionization \cite{LMV_1983_7}, i.e. the~flux inhibition and Kn$^e$ are
approximately the~same when varying $\Zbar= 10, 2, 1$ in 
\figref{fig:C7_Aladin_case3}, 
\figref{fig:C7_Calder_case1}, and \figref{fig:C7_Aladin_case5}.
In principle, a~very good performance of AP1 can be observed in all three cases,
where the~heat flux profiles computed using AP1 model equations 
\eqref{eq:AP1f0}, \eqref{eq:AP1f1}, and \eqref{eq:AmpereKinetic} 
(no B field in 1D) match very well to the~computed results 
by Aladin and Calder.
The~distribution function details related to the~point of 
the~heat flux maximum (644 $\mu$m) and to the~point of 
the~nonlocal transport effect (750 $\mu$m) are also shown 
in \figref{fig:C7_Calder_case1}.
The~latter shows a~very good agreement with a~similar result published in
\cite{Sherlock_PoP2017}.
\textit{Here comes the part commenting on distribution function details at 
two points of the heat flux profile: the heat flux maximum; and a highly 
nonlocal point down the temperature gradient. 
The Aladin nonlocal point EDF should be added very soon.}

In addition, the~Knudsen number Kn$^e$ has been varied among the~simulation 
runs in order to address a~broad range of nonlocality of 
the~electron transport corresponding 
to the~laser-heated plasma conditions, i.e. Kn$^e \in (0.0001, 1)$. 
The~variation of Kn$^e$ arises from the~variation
of the~uniform electron density $n_e \in (10^{19}, 10^{23})$ cm$^{-3}$ or 
the~length scale given by the~slope of the~temperature profile 
$s \in (1/2500, 1/25) \mu$m. Results of an~extensive set of simulations of
varying Kn$^e$ is shown in \figref{fig:Kn_results}.

  the~50 $\mu$m slope tanh case. In the case of Kn = 0.56, 
  $q_{Aladin} / q_{AP1}\approx 7.9$.}

When analyzing the~results of \figref{fig:Kn_results} we have found 
an~interesting observation related to stopping effect of electrons.
It turns out, that the~force acting on electrons is dominated by electric field
above some velocity limit $\vmag_{lim}$ and this limit drops down significantly
when the~plasma conditions are more nonlocal, i.e. with increasing Knudsen 
number as can be seen in \tabref{tab:vlim}. As a~consequence, one can see
that when Kn$^{e} \sim 10^{-1}$ the~electrons responsible for the~heat flux
(velocity $\sim$ 3.5 $\vth$) are preferably affected by the~electric field
rather than by collisions.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}
    \hline\hline\\
    %Kn$^e$ & $10^{-4}$ & $10^{-3}$ & $10^{-2}$ & $10^{-1}$ & $1$ \\\\
    Kn$^e$ & $\,\,10^{-4}\,\,$ & $\,\,10^{-3}\,\,$ & $\,\,10^{-2}\,\,$ & $\,\,10^{-1}\,\,$ & $\,\,1\,\,$ \\\\
    \hline\\

  \eqref{eq:v_limit}. Kn$^e$ and $\vth$ are evaluated from the~same 
  plasma profiles.

In every simulation run of AP1 we used 250~velocity groups in order to avoid
numerical errors in modeling of the~electron kinetics. However, a~smaller 
number of groups, e.g. 50, provides a~very similar results 
(an~error around 10$\%$ in the~heat flux).

\subsection{Hohlraum problem}
%While comparisons between the AP1 model and VFP
%codes have previously been performed 8,45 , none have included 
%spatially-inhomogeneous ionisation. 
Additionally to the~steep temperature gradients, the~laser-heated plasma 
experiments also involve steep density gradients and variation in ionization,
which is even more dominant in multi-material targets as in inertial
fusion experiments, e.g. at the interface between the helium gas-fill and 
the ablated high $\Zbar$ plasma.
%, it is critical that the AP1 model be tested 
%in such an environment.

In~\cite{Brodrick_PoP2017}, a~kinetic simulation of such a~test was introduced.
Plasma profiles provided by a~HYDRA simulation in 1D spherical
geometry of a~laser-heated gadolinium hohlraum containing a~typical helium 
gas-fill were used as input for the~IMPACT \cite{Kingham_JCP2004} VFP code. 
Electron temperature $T_e$, electron density $n_e$ and ionisation $\Zbar$ 
profiles shown in \figref{fig:Gd_VFP_10ps_heatflux} at 20 nanoseconds of 
the~HYDRA simulation were used (after spline smoothing) as 
the~initial conditions for the~IMPACT run (in planar geometry). 
For simplicity, the Coulomb logarithm was treated as a
constant $\lnc_{ei}$ = $\lnc_{ee}$ = 2.1484. In reality, in the~low-density 
corona $\lnc$ reaches 8, which, however, does not affect the~heat flux profile 
significantly. 

It is worth mentioning that in the~surroundings of the~heat flux maximum 
($\sim 1662 \mu$m) the~profiles of all plasma variables exhibit steep gradients 
with a change from $T_e$ = 2.5 keV, $n_e$ = 5$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{−3}$, 
$\Zbar$ = 2 to $T_e$ = 0.3 keV, $n_e$ = 6$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{−3}$ , 
$\Zbar$ = 44 across approximately 100 $\mu$m 
(between 1600~$\mu$m and 1700~$\mu$m), starting at the~helium-gadolinium 
interface.  

\textit{Of course this subsection is apparently missing some comments 
with respect to the simulations using different kinetic models. 
It is an ongoing process.}
