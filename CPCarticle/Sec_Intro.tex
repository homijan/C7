\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}
%In dealing with the nonequilibrium properties of
%systems whose particles obey an inverse-square law
%of interaction, it is convenient to make use of the fact
%that under most circumstances small-angle collisions
%are much more important than collisions resulting in
%large momentum changes. This leads to the method
%often used for treating such systems, in which one
%expands the collision integrand of the Boltzmann change per
%equation in powers of the momentum collision.

The~first attempts of modern kinetic modeling of plasma can be tracked back 
to the~fifties, when Cohen, Spitzer, and Routly (CSR) \cite{CSR_1950} 
in detail demonstrated the~fact, that in the~ionized gas the~effect of 
Coulomb collisions between electrons and ions predominantly results 
from frequently occurring events of cumulative small deflections 
rather than occasional close encounters. This effect was originally described
by Jeans in \cite{Jeans_BOOK1929} and 
Chandrasekhar \cite{Chandrasekhar_RMP1943} 
proposed to use the~diffusion equation model of the~Fokker-Planck type (FP) 
\cite{Planck_1917}.

%A more generally valid approach to the problem of
%treating changes in a distribution function resulting
%each of which from frequently occurring "events",
%produces a small change in the momentum of a particle,
%is to use the Fokker-Planck equation \cite{Planck_1917}, 
%which has been discussed by Spitzer and collaborators 
%\cite{SpitzerHarm_PR1953} . 
As a~result, a~classical paper by Spitzer and Harm (SH) 
\cite{SpitzerHarm_PR1953} provides the~computed electron distribution function
spanning from low to high Z plasmas, and more importantly, the~current and 
heat flux formulas, which are widely used in almost every plasma hydrodynamic
code nowadays.
%used the formalism of the FP equation to evaluate the collision terms of 
%the~Boltzmann equation under the assumptions that 
%(a) the events producing changes in particle momenta
%are two-body interactions described by the associated
%differential scattering cross sections, and 
%(b) that 
The~distribution function is of the form $f^0+\mu f^1$, where $f^0$ and $f^1$ 
are isotropic and $\mu$, is the direction cosine between the particle 
trajectory and some preferred direction in space. It should be emphasized that
the~SH solution expresses a~small perturbation of equilibrium, i.e. that 
$f^0$ is the~Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and $\mu f^1$ represents 
a~very small deviation.

%It is the purpose of this paper to present the mechanics 
%of two-body collisions in a somewhat simplified
%form, and to derive the Fokker-Planck equation for an function. 
%From this general arbitrary distribution equation such special cases 
%as those of Chandrasekhar and Spitzer may easily be obtained. 
%For more complex situations the equation is suitable for integration by an
%electronic computer \cite{Rosenbluth_PR1957}.

The~actual cornerstone of the~modern FP simulations was set in place
by Rosenbluth \cite{Rosenbluth_PR1957}, when he derived a~simplified form 
of the~FP equation for a~finite expansion of the~distribution function,
where all the~terms are computed according to plasma conditions, including
$f^0$, which of course needs to tend to the~Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

In is the~purpose of this paper to present an~efficient alternative 
to FP model based on the~Albritton-Williams-Bernstein-Swartz 
collision operator (AWBS) \cite{AWBS_PRL1986}.
In Section \ref{sec:AWBSmodel} we propose a~modified form of 
the~AWBS collision operator, where its important properties are further
presented in Section \ref{sec:DiffusiveKinetics} with the~emphasis on its
comparison to the~full FP solution in local diffusive regime. 
Section \ref{sec:BenchmarkingAWBS} focuses on the~performance of the~AWBS 
transport equation model compared to modern kinetic codes including FP codes
Aladin and Impact, and PIC code Calder, where the~cases related to real
laser generated plasma conditions are studied. Finally, the~most important
outcomes of our research are concluded in Section \ref{sec:Conclusions}.
