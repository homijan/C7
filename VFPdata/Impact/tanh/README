All these data files refer to simulations starting from an initial temperature profile:
Te / keV = 425 + 575*tanh( (x-x0)/L)
Where the half ramp length is given by L, and the ramp centre x0 does not affect the phyics and differs simulation to simulation.
For all simulations there are no (frozen) hydrodynamics, electron density is 5x10^20 / cm^3 and log Lambda is 7.09433.
All simulations were performed with either the IMPACT or K2 VFP codes.
The SNB and Spitzer-Harm heat flow profiles were obtained by postprocessing the temperature profiles given by the VFP code at the specified snapshot.
