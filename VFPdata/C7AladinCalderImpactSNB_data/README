# The names of the files are self explaining.
# Starting with the name of the code, which computed the temperature profile.
# Then other files start with this code's name, where heat flux or 
# the distribution function is computed along the temperature profile.
# An example.
# Temperature profile:
# Calder_Te_Z1_ne5e20_tanh50_20ps.txt
# Corresponding heat flux profile by C7:
# CalderC7_Qx_Z1_ne5e20_tanh50_20ps.txt

# Units used:
# standard plasma profiles:
x [microns]
Te [eV]
Qx [W/cm2]
# Distribution function:
v [cm/s]
q1 [erg/cm3]

# q1 is used, i.e. q1 = me/2 * f1 * v^5 
# and q1 must relate to the heat flux as Q = 4pi/3 * int q1 dv.
